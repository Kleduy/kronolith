The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the
Kronolith Calendar Application version H3 (2.2).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application.  It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server.  Supported features include shared
calendars, remote calendars, meeting management, alarms, recurring events, and
a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping
events.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.2-ALPHA) are:
    * Finished WebDAV support for external calendar clients.
    * Improved selection of displayed calendars and event resources.
    * Customizable event details in calendar and print views.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
