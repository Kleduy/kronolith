The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the
Kronolith Calendar Application version H5 (4.2.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, CalDAV support, shared calendars, remote calendars,
invitation management (iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource
management, alarms, recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view which
handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping events. For more information on
Kronolith, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Kronolith H5 (4.2.0).  We
encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, strings should not
change before the final release.
