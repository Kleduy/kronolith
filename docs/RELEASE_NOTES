The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H4 (3.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is considered feature complete but there are likely to be
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production
data. Migration of data from earlier versions has not been fully tested yet and
is not supported.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.3) are:

    * Updated for Horde 4
    * New AJAX frontend with integrated tasks support
    * New mobile frontend
    * Resource scheduling
    * System calendars
    * Calendar coloring
    * Calendar and event tagging
    * Cross-timezone support
    * CalDAV client support
    * Improved recurring event exceptions
    * Improved notification and invitation messages
