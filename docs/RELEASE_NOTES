The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H5 (4.2.10).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, CalDAV support, shared calendars, remote calendars,
invitation management (iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource
management, alarms, recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view which
handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping events. For more information on
Kronolith, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

For upgrading instructions, please see

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see

The major changes compared to Kronolith version H5 (4.2.9) are:
    * Fix exporting events from Horde_Perms::SHOW calendars over DAV.
    * Send CACNEL iTip when attendee is removed from a meeting.
    * Fix incorrect offset of freebusy times in certain cases.
    * Fix handling of email groups as attendees.
    * Fix importing text/calendar data via API.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
